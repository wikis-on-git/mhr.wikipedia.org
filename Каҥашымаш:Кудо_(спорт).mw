==Images and videos for Kudo in Wikipedia Commons==
Hello all international Wikipedia users! I have collected all Wikipedia Commons-compatible Kudo-images from all international Wikipedia versions and bundled them into a separate category at Wikipedia Commons, so all international Wikipedia versions can easily integrate those images into their Kudo articles without having any license problems to worry about.

You will find the category and it's images (and hopefully videos in the future) here: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:K%C5%ABd%C5%8D https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kūdō]
Please feel free to insert those images in the Wikipedia of your own language!

And if you should have some nice images or videos of Kudo to upload to this category at Wikipedia Commons yourself, please do so, we still can use some more high quality images and videos of Kudo!
